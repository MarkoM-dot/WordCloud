# WordCloud
Summary:
Python code that generates a word cloud from a text file where the size of the word is proportional to its frequency found in the text.

The image below was generated through calculating the frequencies of words found in Plutarch's 'Life of Solon'. I used an image of the parthenon as the mask. 
You are welcome to use your own text and mask.
